This Privacy Policy applies to the "Offline Games Without Internet" mobile application ("App") created by Vikash. This App is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

## Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.**

"Offline Games Without Internet" is designed to be a fully offline experience. The App does not require an internet connection to function, does not require you to create an account, and does not track your personal data. 

All game progress, scores, and settings are saved locally on your device using standard local storage mechanisms. We do not have access to this data.

The App does not use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. There are no external analytics or targeted advertising trackers embedded within the core gameplay loop.

## Children's Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any data, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
